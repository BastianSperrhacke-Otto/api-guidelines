# Deprecation of obsoleted API versions and components

Sometimes it is necessary to phase out an API, an API version, or an API feature.
For example, a property is no longer supported, or a whole business functionality is supposed to be shut down.
As long as consumers still use deprecated API features, these shutdowns are breaking changes and are not allowed.
The following deprecation rules have to be applied to ensure that the necessary consumer changes and actions are well communicated and aligned using _deprecation_ and _sunset_ schedules.
The deprecation phase precedes the final sunset date.
