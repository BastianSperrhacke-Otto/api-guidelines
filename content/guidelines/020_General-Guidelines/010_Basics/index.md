# Basics

This section contains basic rules and concepts that lay the groundwork for API type-specific rules.

## Definitions

**API specification** - A document that describes the contract between the API provider and the API consumer. For example, an AsyncAPI or OpenAPI specification. Commonly denoted as "specification" or "contract".

**API** - By the term API, we refer to the software implementation of the API specification that API clients can use.

**API client** - A software application that uses the API. Commonly denoted as "client".

**API provider** - The team or organization owning and providing the API specification. Most of the time, the API provider also provides an API specification-conform API. Commonly denoted as "provider".

**API consumer** - The team or organization that uses an API by creating an API client. Commonly denoted as "consumer".
