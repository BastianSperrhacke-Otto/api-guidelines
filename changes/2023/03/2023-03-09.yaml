      - Renamed rule "MUST use absolute URLs for custom link relation types"
      to "MUST use absolute URIs for custom link relation types". The
      requirement for a `https://api.otto.de/portal` prefix has been removed,
      and it is no longer required to provide resolvable link relation URIs.
      (R100037)
      - The "Profile" section previously being found in "Hypermedia" has been
      merged into the section "Versioning of incompatible changes" because
      profiles are used for versioning of hypermedia and non-hypermedia APIs.
      - Renamed rule "MUST use profiles for Public REST APIs" to "MUST use
      profiles for versioning" to better indicate the purpose of profiles. The
      content describing the concept of a profile in depth has been moved from
      the section "Profile" to this rule. Added further description and
      examples to highlight better how to leverage profiles. (R000065)
      - The rule "MUST use resolvable profile URLs" has been moved to
      "Compatibility"->"Versioning of incompatible changes" and renamed to
      "MUST use absolute URIs for profiles". The requirement for a
      `https://api.otto.de/portal` prefix for profile URIs has been removed,
      and it is no longer required to provide resolvable profile URIs.
      (R100066)
      - Removed the rule "MAY use type and profile attributes in hyperlinks"
      because the cardinality of the profile link may change and profile URIs
      are no longer resolvable.
      - Removed the rule "Must use kebab-case profile URIs" as it is a
      duplicate of "MUST use kebab-case for URIs". (R000023)
      - Removed the rule "SHOULD NOT use resource versioned path" as it is a
      duplicate of "SHOULD NOT use URI versioning". (R000026)
