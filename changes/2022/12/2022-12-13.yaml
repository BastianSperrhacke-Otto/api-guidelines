    body: >-
      - Removed "key" and enforced a more sensible usage of the "type"

      property (r000034).

      - Reworked to point to ValidationError documentation. Mention that

      `about:blank` should be used for problems that do not add any semantics

      to the status code (r000037).

      - Reworked to clearly state that a resolvable type documentation is not

      required. The type is primarily used as an identifier, as stated in the

      RFC. Add an example of a type documentation. Clearly stating that a

      context-specific type can be introduced (r000040).

      - Fixed so that the table is displayed again. Changed so that only

      status 400 is allowed for ValidationError to comply with the RFC that

      states that only one status is associated with a type. (r000038)
