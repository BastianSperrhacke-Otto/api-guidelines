## <span style="color: #69AF1F;">SHOULD NOT</span> use resource versioned path

Version numbers in URLs should not be used. However, if the preferred versioning option is not possible,
[resource versioned path](../topics/versioning.md#resource-versioned-paths) may be introduced, if absolutely required.
