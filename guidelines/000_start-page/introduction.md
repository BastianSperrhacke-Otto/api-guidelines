title: OTTO API Guidelines

## Introduction

The OTTO API Guidelines define standards and guidelines for building REST APIs at OTTO's E-Commerce department.

OTTO E-Commerce consists of various microservice teams that aim to provide functionality for the OTTO webshop via RESTful APIs.
Our APIs are a valuable part of our business assets, as with APIs we generate the corresponding operating values.
Ideally, by applying the API guidelines, all APIs look as if they were created by a single team, thus providing API consumers with a homogeneous, easy-to-use product.
This facilitates a great developer experience and the ability to quickly compose complex business processes.

With this in mind, we trust that our teams build APIs that are:

* RESTful
* self-explanatory
* easy to use
* of high quality
* transparently versioned

## How to read the guidelines

This guide is a living document and will be revised over time as new rules are added or existing rules are modified. 

The guidelines are structured into individual rules that use the key words "MUST", "SHOULD", and "MAY".
These keywords are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).
In this document, such keywords are highlighted in uppercase letters at the beginning of each section.
