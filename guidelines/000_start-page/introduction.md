title: OTTO API Guidelines
---

The OTTO API Guidelines define standards and guidelines for building REST APIs at OTTO's E-Commerce department.

OTTO E-Commerce consists of various microservice teams that aim to provide functionality for the OTTO webshop via RESTful APIs.
Our APIs are a valuable part of our business assets, as with APIs we generate the corresponding operating values.
Ideally, by applying the API guidelines, all APIs look as if they were created by a single team, thus providing API consumers with a homogeneous, easy-to-use product.

With this in mind, we trust that our teams build APIs that are:

* RESTful
* self-explanatory
* easy to use
* of high quality
* transparently versioned
