# provide API user guide

TODO

::: warning
All private OTTO API endpoints should be published along with an API user guide.
:::

In order to improve the developer experience of API consumers, especially of engineers that are less experienced in using the OTTO API, it is good practice to provide an API user guide along with the API reference (provided via the API spec).
A helpful API user guide typically describes aspects such as:

- API scope, purpose, and use cases
- Concrete examples of API usage
- Error handling information and solution support
- Architectural context and manjor dependencies, including illustrations and flow charts

The user guide must be published online together with the API reference.
