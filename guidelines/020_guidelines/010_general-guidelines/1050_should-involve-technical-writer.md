# involve technical writer

Any description that has been provided by developers in the Open API specification should undergo a copy editing and proofreading process by a technical writer.
As explanations might be too difficult to understand for the audience, might not be sufficiently described, or can contain inconsistently used terminology all texts should be edited by a technical writer.
