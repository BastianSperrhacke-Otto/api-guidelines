# provide API documentation

> TO DO

In order to improve the developer experience of API consumers, especially of engineers that are less experienced in using the OTTO API, it is good practice to provide API documentation along with the API reference (provided via the API spec). A helpful API user manual typically describes the following API aspects:

API scope, purpose, and use cases

concrete examples of API usage

edge cases, error situation details, and repair hints

architecture context and major dependencies - including figures and sequence flows

The user manual must be published online, e.g. via our documentation hosting platform service, GHE pages, or specific team web servers. Please do not forget to include a link to the API user manual into the API specification using the #/externalDocs/url property.

SHOULD für Level 2, MUST für Level 3
