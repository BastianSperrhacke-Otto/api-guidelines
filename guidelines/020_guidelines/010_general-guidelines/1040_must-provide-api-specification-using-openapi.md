# provide API specification using OpenAPI

We use the OpenAPI specification as a standard to define API specification files.
Every API must be described using the OpenAPI specification.
All teams that design APIs are required to provide the API specification using a single self-contained YAML file to improve readability.
The API description format used must be [OpenAPI 3.0](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification).
We will extend it according to our needs by using vendor tags in order to describe the functionality that we require.
