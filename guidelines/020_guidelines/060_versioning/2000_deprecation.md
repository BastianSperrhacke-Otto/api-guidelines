# Deprecation

Sometimes it is necessary to phase out an API endpoint, an API version, or an API feature, e.g. if a field or parameter is no longer supported or a whole business functionality behind an endpoint is supposed to be shut down. As long as the API endpoints and features are still used by consumers these shutdowns are breaking changes and not allowed. To progress the following deprecation rules have to be applied to make sure that the necessary consumer changes and actions are well communicated and aligned using _deprecation_ and _sunset_ dates. A deprecation phase preceeds the final sunset date.
