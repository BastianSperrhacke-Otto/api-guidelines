# collect external partner consent on deprecation time span

If the API is consumed by anyone, the API owner must define a reasonable time span that the API will be maintained after the producer has announced deprecation. All consumers must state consent with this after-deprecation-life-span, i.e. the minimum time span between official deprecation and first possible sunset, **before** they are allowed to use the API.
