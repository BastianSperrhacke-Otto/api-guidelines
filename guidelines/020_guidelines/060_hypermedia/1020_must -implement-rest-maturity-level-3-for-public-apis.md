# implement REST Maturity Level 3 for public APIs

According to the [Richardson Maturity Model](https://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html), an API interface can only be described as RESTful if it complies with the HATEOAS principle, i.e. Maturity Level 3.
For public APIs, you must implement [REST Maturity Level 3](https://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html#level3), using the HAL+JSON format.
