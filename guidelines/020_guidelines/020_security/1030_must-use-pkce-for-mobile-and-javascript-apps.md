# use Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) for mobile and JavaScript apps

PKCE ([RFC 7636](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636)) is an extension to the Authorization Code flow to prevent certain attacks and to be able to securely perform the OAuth 2.0 exchange from public clients.

This technique can be applied to any client as well.
