# OAuth 2.0

The API uses [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) for authorization.

In our implementation we strive to be as standard compatible as possible.

The OTTO API provides an endpoint that can be used for [OAuth 2.0 endpoint discovery](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-discovery-06): `https://api.otto.de/.well-known/openid-configuration`. Clients can use the returned
information to obtain information about the OAuth 2.0 authorization server such as the token and userinfo endpoints as well as the supported OAuth 2.0 flows.
