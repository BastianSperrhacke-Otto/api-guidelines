# use common query parameters

To provide a consistent look and feel of pagination patterns, you must stick to the common query parameter names.

Relevant query parameters are:

- paging (offset): `size`, `page`
- sorting: `sort`
- querying, filtering: `q`

TODO: add link to common query params below

Please refer to the common query parameters section for more details.

Make sure to add query parameters (that differ from the default) to HAL links if necessary.
