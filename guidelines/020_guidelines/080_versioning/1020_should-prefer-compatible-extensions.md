# prefer compatible extensions

API designers should apply the following rules to evolve RESTful APIs for services in a backward-compatible way:

- Refer to best practices when adding new fields (read [Compatibility](https://github.com/otto-ec/ottoapi_guidelines/blob/master/references/compatibility.md))
- Never change the semantic of fields (e.g. changing the semantic from customer-number to customer-id, as both are different unique customer keys)
- Input fields may have (complex) constraints being validated via server-side business logic. Never change the validation logic to be more restrictive and make sure that all constraints are clearly defined in description.
- Enum ranges can be reduced when used as input parameters, only if the server is ready to accept and handle old range values too. Enum range can be reduced when used as output parameters.
- Enum ranges cannot be extended when used for output parameters â€” clients may not be prepared to handle it. However, enum ranges can be extended when used for input parameters.
- Support redirection in case an URL has to change `HTTP 301 Moved Permanently`.
