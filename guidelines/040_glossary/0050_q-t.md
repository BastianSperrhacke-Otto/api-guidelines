## Resource

According to [RESTful API Design](https://restful-api-design.readthedocs.io/en/latest/resources.html#:~:text=The%20fundamental%20concept%20in%20any,methods%20that%20operate%20on%20it.&text=Collections%20can%20exist%20globally%2C%20at,contained%20inside%20a%20single%20resource.) a resource is an object with a type, associated data, relationships to other resources, and a set of methods that operate on it.
It is similar to an object instance in an object-oriented programming language, with the important difference that only a few standard methods are defined for the resource (corresponding to the standard HTTP GET, POST, PUT and DELETE methods), while an object instance typically has many methods.

## Resource representation

According to [REST API Tutorial](https://restfulapi.net/#:~:text=A%20representation%20consists%20of%20data,representation%20is%20to%20be%20processed) a resource representation is the state of the resource at any particular timestamp.
It consists of data, metadata describing the data and hypermedia links which can help the clients in transition to the next desired state.
