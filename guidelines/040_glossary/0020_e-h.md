## HATEOAS

Short for _Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State_.
As the architectural style of REST is supposed to provide a universal interface, HATEOAS requires that the REST client can move through the web application exclusively by following URIs (Uniform Resource Identifier) in hypermedia format.
If HATEOAS is implemented, the client does not need any further information apart from a basic understanding of hypermedia in order to interact with the service.
