# U - Z

## URI

Short for _uniform resource identifier_.
According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier) it is a string of characters that unambiguously identifies a particular resource.
To guarantee uniformity, all URIs follow a predefined set of syntax rules, but also maintain extensibility through a separately defined hierarchical naming scheme.
