## URI

Short for _uniform resource identifier_.
A [URI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier) is a string of characters that unambiguously identifies a particular resource.

To guarantee uniformity, all URIs follow a predefined set of syntax rules, but also maintain extensibility through a separately defined hierarchical naming scheme.

## URL

A Uniform Resource Locator (URL), colloquially termed a web address, is a reference to a web resource that specifies 
its location on a computer network and a mechanism for retrieving it. 

A URL is a specific type of Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), although many people use the two terms interchangeably.

## YAML

Short for _Yet Another Markup Language_.
[YAML](https://yaml.org/) is a human friendly data serialization standard for all programming languages.
