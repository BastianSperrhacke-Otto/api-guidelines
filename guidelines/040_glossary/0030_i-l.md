# I - L

## IANA

Short for _Internet Assigned Numbers Authority_.
[IANA](https://www.iana.org/) allocates and maintains unique codes and numbering systems that are used in the technical standards (“protocols”) that drive the Internet.

## ID

Short for _Identifier_.
According to [API Platform](https://api-platform.com/docs/core/identifiers/) every item operation has an identifier in its URL.
Although this identifier is usually a number, it can also be an UUID, a date, or the type of your choice.

## Idempotency

An operation is called [idempotent](https://www.restapitutorial.com/lessons/idempotency.html), if clients can make that same call repeatedly while producing the same result.
In other words, making multiple identical requests has the same effect as making a single request.
While idempotent operations produce the same result on the server (no side effects), the response itself may not be the same (e.g. a resource's state may change between requests).

See also [RFC-7231](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.2.2).

## JSON

Short for _JavaScript Object Notation_.
Compact format to exchange data between applications.
For further details, see [json.org](https://www.json.org/json-en.html).

## JWKS

[JWKS](https://auth0.com/docs/tokens/concepts/jwks) is a set of keys which contains the public keys used to verify any JSON Web Token (JWT) issued by the authorization server and signed using the RS256 signing algorithm.

See also [RFC-7517](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517#page-5).

## JWT

Short for _JSON Web Token_, pronounced _jot_.

A [JWT](https://jwt.io/introduction/) is an open standard that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.
This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed.
JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.
