## Idempotency

According to [REST API Tutorial](https://www.restapitutorial.com/lessons/idempotency.html), for an operation to be idempotent, clients can make that same call repeatedly while producing the same result.
In other words, making multiple identical requests has the same effect as making a single request.
While idempotent operations produce the same result on the server (no side effects), the response itself may not be the same (e.g. a resource's state may change between requests).
