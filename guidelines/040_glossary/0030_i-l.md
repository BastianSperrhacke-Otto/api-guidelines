## Idempotency

According to [REST API Tutorial](https://www.restapitutorial.com/lessons/idempotency.html), for an operation to be idempotent, clients can make that same call repeatedly while producing the same result.
In other words, making multiple identical requests has the same effect as making a single request.
While idempotent operations produce the same result on the server (no side effects), the response itself may not be the same (e.g. a resource's state may change between requests).

## JSON

Short for _JavaScript Object Notation_.
Compact format to exchange data between applications.
For further details, see [json.org](https://www.json.org/json-en.html).

## JWKS

Short for _JSON Web Key Set_.
According to [Auth0](https://auth0.com/docs/tokens/concepts/jwks) JWKS is a set of keys which contains the public keys used to verify any JSON Web Token (JWT) issued by the authorization server and signed using the RS256 signing algorithm.

## JWT

Short for _JSON Web Token_, pronounced _jot_.
According to [JWT](https://jwt.io/introduction/) it is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.
This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed.
JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.
