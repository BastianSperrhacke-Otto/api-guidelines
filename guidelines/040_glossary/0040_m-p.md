## Media type

A [media type (formerly known as MIME type)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types) is a two-part identifier for file formats and format contents transmitted on the Internet.
A media type defines both the semantics and the serialization of a specific type of content.

The [Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)](https://www.iana.org/) is the official authority for the standardization and publication of these classifications.
Find the most up-to-date and complete list on their [Media Types](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml) page.

## OAuth 2.0

[OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) is the industry-standard protocol for authorization.
OAuth 2.0 focuses on client developer simplicity while providing specific authorization flows for web applications, desktop applications, mobile phones, and living room devices.

See also [RFC-6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749).

## OpenAPI

API description format for REST APIs.
An [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/) specification file allows the description of an entire API.
If the specification file is valid, it can be used to create documentation, generate SDKs, perform unit tests, and more.

## Pagination

The use of query parameters to provide a limited number of items per request in an API response.

## PKCE

Short for [_Proof Key for Code Exchange_](https://oauth.net/2/pkce/), pronounced _pixie_.
An extension to the Authorization Code flow to prevent certain attacks and to be able to securely perform the OAuth exchange from public clients.

## Profile

Many media types like, for example, application/json or application/xml are meta-formats - extensible frameworks for 
carrying a wide variety of types of data. Using profiles, such media types can be restricted to more specific types of data.

A Profile is an identifier (URI) for some kind of specification that tells us, how additional data and semantics can be 
extracted from a document in a given media type. For example, a Profile `http://api.otto.de/profiles/product` can be
used to tell some API consumer, that the returned `application/json` document has a specified structure, containg a 
`productId` attribute, a couple of `variations`, and so on.

It is good practice to use URLs for profiles, that can be resolved to a human-readable specification.
