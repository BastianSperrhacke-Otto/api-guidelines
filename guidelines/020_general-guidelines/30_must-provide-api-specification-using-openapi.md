# provide API specification using Open API

We use the Open API specification as standard to define API specification files.
Every API MUST be described using the Open API specification.
All teams that design APIs are required to provide the API specification using a single self-contained YAML file to improve readability.
The API description format used MUST be [Open API 3.0](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/).
We will extend it according to our needs by using vendor tags in order to describe the functionality that we require.
