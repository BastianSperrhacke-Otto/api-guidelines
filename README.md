## OTTO API Manifesto

This repository is the source for establishing a uniform API standard, which serves as a set of rules for the creation of new APIs within MA-EC.
(In the future, this standard can also be used to unify existing APIs.)
The [API Manifesto](/manifesto.md) helps to establish this standard and comprises values that a work group has agreed upon in advance.

### Who is the work group (aka API AG)

* Birgit Bader (PrcssMngr ShoZu)
* Eugen Baier (PL ShoZu)
* Nico Engelhardt (TD Assets)
* Jens Fischer (API Champion FT1)
* Martin Kalsow (TD FT4)
* Martin Knudsen (TD Apps)
* Dennis Pattmann (TD ShoZu)
* Guido Steinacker (TD FT3)
* (supported by Jens Boening) (TD FT Find)

### Mode of operation

- We have several small focus groups. Each of the groups has a lead. ðŸ’¡The groups have the option to get further colleagues (e.g. API Champions) on board that can bring value to a specific topic.
- The lead kicks off the topic, and creates a branch on GitHub with the intial suggestion.
ðŸ’¡Use the [topics](https://github.com/otto-ec/ottoapi_manifest/tree/master/topics) folder for work in progress and comments.
- Once there's a good basis for discussion, the lead schedules a meeting with the goal to find consent.
- The focus group presents the result in the next API AG jour fixe.
- The lead documents the final result on GitHub.
ðŸ’¡Use the [decisions](https://github.com/otto-ec/ottoapi_manifest/tree/master/decisions) folder for result documentation.
- The API AG informs/presents the results in the API Champions meeting.

### Outlook

Once there's a sound basis that we can work with, we will set up a PoC to show implementation possibilities of the standard against which the F-Teams can test and give feedback.

Step by step, a set of rules will be established that form the basis of the future API development.
