# OTTO API Guidelines

<https://api.develop.otto.de/api-docs/guidelines/>

This repository is the source for establishing a uniform API standard (aka API Guidelines), which serves as a set of rules for the creation of new APIs within MA-EC.
(In the future, this standard can also be used to unify existing APIs.)
The [API Manifesto](/manifesto.md) helps to establish this standard and comprises values that we have agreed upon in advance.
