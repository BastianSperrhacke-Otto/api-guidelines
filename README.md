## OTTO API Manifesto

This repository is the source for establishing of a uniform API standard, which serves as a set of rules for the creation of new APIs within MA-EC.
(In the future, this standard can also be used to unify existing APIs.)
An [API Manifesto](/manifesto.md) helps to establish this standard.
The manifesto comprises values we have agreed upon in advance.

As a first step, several small work groups prepare proposals on essential topics, which are then approved and published in the standard.
Next up, a PoC will be developed showing implementation possibilities of the standard against which the F-Teams can test and give feedback.

Step by step, a set of rules will be established that form the basis of the future API development.
