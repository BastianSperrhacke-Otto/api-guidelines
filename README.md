# OTTO API Guidelines

<https://api.develop.otto.de/api-docs/guidelines/>

This repository is the source for establishing a uniform API standard (aka API Guidelines), which serves as a set of rules for the creation of new APIs within MA-EC.
(In the future, this standard can also be used to unify existing APIs.)
The [API Manifesto](/manifesto.md) helps to establish this standard and comprises values that a work group has agreed upon in advance.

## Who is the work group (aka API AG)

- Birgit Bader (PrcssMngr ShoZu)
- Eugen Baier (PL ShoZu)
- Nico Engelhardt (TD Assets)
- Jens Fischer (API Champion FT1)
- Ulf Sauer (API Champion FT4)
- Martin Knudsen (TD Apps)
- Dennis Pattmann (TD ShoZu)
- Guido Steinacker (TD FT3)
- (supported by Jens Boening (TD FT Find) and Martin Kalsow (TD FT4))

## Mode of operation

- We have several small focus groups. Each of the groups has a lead. The groups have the option to get further colleagues (e.g. API Champions) on board that can bring value to a specific topic.
- We create issues for each topic and use the [topics](https://github.com/otto-ec/ottoapi_manifest/tree/master/topics) folder for work in progress and comments. Furthermore, we use the issue for comments.
- Once there's a good basis for discussion, the lead schedules a meeting with the goal to find consent.
- The focus group presents the result in the next API AG meeting.
- The lead documents the final result in the [decisions](https://github.com/otto-ec/ottoapi_manifest/tree/master/decisions) folder.
- The API AG informs/presents the results in the API Champions meeting.

## Guidelines

Taking the decisions of the API AG as the basis, we will establish a set of rules that form the basis of the future API development.
These rules will be published as the OTTO API Guidelines and, once finalized, will be available at api.otto.de.

## PoC

Once there's a sound basis of decisions, we will set up a PoC to show implementation possibilities of the standard against which the F-Teams can test and give feedback.
