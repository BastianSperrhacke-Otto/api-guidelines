## Quality standard

"We meet the quality standards of a public API." 
What does that mean?

Let's assume that someone wants our API public by tomorrow.
External users outside of the OTTO Group should be able to consume our API immediately.
In this case our API should meet a certain quality standard in order for these consumers to use it properly, and for us to being able to flawlessly make this immediate change.
This requires:

### REST implementation

* easy to use and understand (makes it easy for other developers to understand and write services against)
* uses HTTP and basic CRUD operations (it's simple to write and document)
* designed to be stateless
* supports many data formats, but the predominant use of JSON means better support for browser clients. (JSON sets a standardized method for consuming API payloads.)

### Provide software and service functionality

... and at the same time secure the rest of the application

### Uniform product

* our API endpoints are developed by heterogeneous and independent functional teams, but we strive to maintain homogeneity to the outside

### Free of security flaws

### Can be used by various clients

* no custom data formats
* using Open Source Technologies and Community-based standards

### Sound API Management

* communicate changes and deprecations
* happy API consumers (if changes to an API are not properly managed, users become dissatisfied.)

### https/SSL certificates

### Unified authentication

### Automation

### Developer Experience

API consumers should have fun using the API.
Our aim is to provide seamless experience to developers when writing software, and to increase their efficiency.
API consumers should be comfortable calling our API in their chosen programming language, finding the functionality they need, as well as using the output.
