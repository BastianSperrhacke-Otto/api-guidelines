## Requirements

### EDITORIAL

#### Getting started

Basic information is available at one place, such as info about HTTP verbs, API operations, Request/Response headers, Versioning, Pagination, or errors.

Example: 


#### User-friendly navigation

All relevant entry points that are required to properly use the API are located in the sidebar.

Example:

#### Clear and structured

All information is easily discoverable (no deep nesting), easy to digest, and prepared in a way that the consumer can effectively work with it.

Example:


#### TechWriter accessible

TechWriters are allowed to create PRs on doc-related content on the team repos.

Easy option for TechWriting to provide editorial content via Pull Requests (reviewable by developers).

API reference docs are located outside of the code (key/value) and can be easily accessed and updated by TechWriting.

Example:



#### Working environment and review process

Content for API reference as well as editorial content is created in the development environment.

Review process is done in the development environment.

Example:

#### Default values in example requests/responses

The request and response examples that belong to every endpoint documentation have meaningful default values that follow a specific story.
These values are created/reviewed with the help of TechWriting.

For using example email addresses, phone numbers, and such refer to https://developers.google.com/style/examples

### TECHNICAL

#### Automated API reference documentation

The API reference documentation is created and published automatically. 

#### Automated changelog

A changelog/revision history is available in order for the API consumers to be up to date with the latest API changes.
This changelog is created automatically (but can be cosmetically changed by TechWriting).

#### TechWriter accessible

API reference docs are located outside of the code (key/value) and can be easily accessed and updated by TechWriting.

#### Postman collection

A JSON file is generated to provide the API consumers with a preconfigured collection in Postman that holds the all public API resources.

### STRUCTURE

#### Searchbar

The documentation provides a search.

#### Collapsible sidebar

The documentation can be easily browsed and the endpoints can be accessed via the sidebar.

#### Code examples

Every endpoint comes with an example request and response

#### Request & Response property tables

Incl. "Constraints" column

### CONCEPTUAL

#### Familiarization with the API

Intuitive familiarization vs conceptual information
Which specific problem should be tackled with the API?
Structure should be designed accordingly.

### NICE TO HAVE

Visual separation between code examples and explanatory text.
