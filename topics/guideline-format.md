# Target format for API guidelines

As we are currently working on a new standard for our OTTO API, we should consider where and how to provide the resulting guidelines. 
The focus should be on making the guidelines easily accessible and digestible for our target group as well as on ensuring that the format is well accepted by the users.

In order to achieve this, we need to evaluate the possible options in terms of medium, format, layout, structure, navigation.

## Medium

### Confluence

Publishing the guidelines on the intranet is a possible option.

**PROS**

* Confluence is a classic documentation tool and already in use at OTTO
* Open system that every employee can access and contribute to content development (collaborative editing)
* Easy to use
* Content can be structured to our needs
* Allows for proper navigation via the page tree

**CONS**

* Custom layout is restricted
* Cannot be published as HTML (only intranet, word, pdf)
* Current FT4 guidelines are published in Confluence, but don't seem to be well received
